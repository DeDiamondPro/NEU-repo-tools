# NEU wiki links adder
 
This repository is made for a program I'm developing to automatically add (some) wiki links to the NEU json repo

To use:
- Create a folder repo
- put the updated repository in the folder repo
- create a folder info
- create a folder modified

In the folder info it will show wich items it modified and wich it knows has no wiki link but couldn't do.
in the folder modified it will put all json files it modified.

NOTE: if you plan on using this, this program isn't perfect so check all wiki links before creating a pull request with the main branch of NEU.
